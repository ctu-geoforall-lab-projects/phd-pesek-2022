## Title

Possibilities of convolutional neural networks use for remote sensing image
classification

## Description

In recent years, the speed of technological progress in certain science fields
is getting faster and faster. It is making it hard for other scientific areas
to keep up with this tempo. One of the exemplary relationships is the link
between artificial and convolutional neural network structures and the province
of geomatics or remote sensing. New architectures of artificial neural network
models are being published with an expeditious tempo and the common approach of
the remote sensing researchers is to use the most recent structures, without
the basic understanding of the background or relative performance. The goal of
this thesis is to perform systematic research on the possibilities of use of
chosen convolutional neural network architectures on various selected use cases
from the field of remote sensing.
