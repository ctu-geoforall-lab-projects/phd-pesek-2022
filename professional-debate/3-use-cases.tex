\label{use-cases}

The best comparison is the one using things readers already know. The best comparison is the one from the real world and praxis.

% TODO: After the professional debate, delete the note about it
As the aim of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of different \zk{CNN} models on different tasks from the field of remote sensing and make an order in \textit{why is an~architecture X used on Y}, use cases chosen for experiments should correspond with tasks normal remote sensing researchers could face. This chapter presents a~research on these chosen use cases (currently - for the purpose of the professional debate - the phrase \textit{use cases} should be actually used in a singular form as there is only one use case so far).
